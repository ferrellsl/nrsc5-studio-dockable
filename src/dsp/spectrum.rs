//! FFT tap that produces a live spectrum + scrolling waterfall buffer for
//! the Spectrum dock panel.
//!
//! ## Pipeline
//!
//! The piped-SDR I/Q thread (see [`crate::ffi::Nrsc5Process::start_piped`])
//! holds an `Arc<SpectrumTap>` and, on every USB transfer batch, calls
//! [`SpectrumTap::feed`] with the raw 8-bit unsigned I/Q bytes that are
//! also being fed to `nrsc5.exe`. `feed` is throttled internally so the
//! work it does is bounded regardless of how often it's called.
//!
//! Each accepted batch is:
//! 1. converted to centered `Complex<f32>` (sample `s = (b - 127.5) / 127.5`),
//! 2. multiplied by a precomputed Hann window,
//! 3. transformed by a cached rustfft plan,
//! 4. magnitude-squared and converted to dB,
//! 5. fft-shifted so 0 Hz lands at the center bin,
//! 6. stored as the "latest spectrum" and pushed as a new row into the
//!    rolling waterfall (a flat `u8` ring buffer where each cell is the
//!    bin's intensity normalized to a tunable dB floor / ceiling).
//!
//! The dock panel reads the shared state under the same `Arc<Mutex<…>>`
//! on every paint via [`SpectrumTap::snapshot`].
//!
//! ## Why no separate worker thread
//!
//! A 1024-point complex FFT is ~50 µs on a modern CPU. At the throttled
//! ~30 FFTs/sec target the panel needs, that's < 0.2 % of one core, well
//! below the cost of moving samples across a channel. Keeping the work on
//! the I/Q thread also means there is exactly one writer to the shared
//! state, so the mutex is uncontended in practice (the panel locks for
//! a few microseconds at paint time).
